Dimensions of the image being grayscaled: (rain.jpg)
  (height)  H - 400
   (width)  W - 600
(channels)  C - 3


Timing: numba_color2sepia
Average runtime running numpy_color2gray after 3 runs: 0.031271 s
Average runtime for running numba_color2sepia is 700 times
  faster than python_color2sepia
Average runtime running numba_color2sepia is 0.5 times
  faster than numpy_color2sepia
Timing performed using: timeit library
                        print("Average: ", timeit.timeit(numba_color2sepia, number=3)/3)
                        print("Average: ", timeit.timeit(numba_color2sepia, number=400)/400)
                        print("Average: ", timeit.timeit(numba_color2sepia, number=1000)/1000)


Time is almost the same as with numpy when the number of images is not high.
So I recommend to use the numpy because it have same time almost for any
number of images
Disadvantage with numba is that it first runs will take a long time.
